Metropolis-Hastings (MH) serves as a cornerstone in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, yet its reversibility may hinder efficiency in exploring complex state spaces. In this work, we introduce an extension of the MH algorithm, termed Non-Reversible Metropolis-Hastings (NRMH), to generate non-reversible Markov chains. The key innovation lies in the modification of the acceptance probability, leveraging the concept of the vorticity matrix. The resulting Markov chain exhibits non-reversibility, offering potential advantages in sampling efficiency. Drawing from the literature on asymptotic variance, large deviations theory, and mixing time, we highlight the favorable
properties of non-reversible Markov chains in these contexts. Specifically, we adapt results from the large deviations theory to elucidate the advantageous properties of NRMH. To demonstrate the applicability of NRMH in continuous settings, we develop the necessary theoretical framework and apply it to Gaussian distributions in three and nine dimensions. Empirical evaluations, including auto-correlation analysis and estimation of asymptotic variance, reveal substantial improvements in NRMH over MH with identical step sizes. This study underscores the promising prospects of non-reversible MCMC methods in enhancing sampling efficiency and exploring high-dimensional spaces.
